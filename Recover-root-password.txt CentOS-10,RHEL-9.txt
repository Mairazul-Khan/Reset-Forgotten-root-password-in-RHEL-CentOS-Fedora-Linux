rd.break does not work in RHEL 9.0. or centos stream 10.

For RHEL 9.0 / centos stream 10:-

1: Reboot the system. When the grub bootloader screen appears, use the UpArrow and DownArrow keys or Click on the highlighted option with your mouse to initiate the boot process. to stop the countdown timer. Be very quick, as the timer can be set anything from 1 to 5 seconds.

2: Ensure the kernel you intend to boot into is highlighted and press the "e" key to edit the entry.

3: On the linux line: replace "ro" with "rw" and Add "init=/bin/bash" at the end of that line.

4: Press Ctrl x to continue.

5: At the bash-5.1# prompt, enter the passwd command to change root’s password

6: Enter new password

7: Enter the touch /.autorelabel command.

8: Enter the exec /sbin/init command to reboot the system.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The system will now reboot and relabel (because of the existence of the /.autorelabel file from step 7) all the directories and files in the filesystem. It can take a long time (especially if there are lot of objects on the system).

The system will delete /.autorelabel file and reboot again, normally.

At this point, you should be able to log in as root using the password you’ve set.
